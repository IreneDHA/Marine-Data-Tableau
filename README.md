MarineData: Exploratory Data Analysis and Interactive Visualizations

Welcome to the MarineData repository—a comprehensive project dedicated to analyzing marine species featured in the National Geographic winning photographs of 2025. This repository applies data science techniques to explore and visualize marine-related datasets, uncovering insights into oceanographic, ecological, and maritime variables captured through these stunning images.

📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create interactive visualizations to identify key trends and patterns within marine species data derived from the National Geographic 2025 winners’ photographs. Utilizing tools such as Python, Tableau, and SQL, the project aims to provide a deeper understanding of marine biodiversity and support informed decision-making in marine science and conservation.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.

Pandas & NumPy: Essential libraries for data processing and statistical analysis.

SQL: Used for database management and querying.

Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

Jupyter Notebooks: To document the analysis process and results.

📁 Repository Structure

🚀 Getting Started

To run the notebooks and replicate the analysis:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/jiucode/Marinedata.git
cd Marinedata

Set up a Python environment and install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open and execute the Jupyter notebooks:
jupyter notebook

Open the Tableau workbook (marinedata_presentation.twbx) to explore the interactive visualizations.

📈 Key Insights

Through the analysis, several significant patterns and trends were identified, including:

Seasonal Variations: Fluctuations in marine variables corresponding to seasonal changes.

Geographical Patterns: Spatial distribution of marine species across different regions.

Correlation Analysis: Relationships between various oceanographic and ecological variables.
