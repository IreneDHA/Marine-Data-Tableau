# MarineData: Exploratory Data Analysis and Interactive Visualizations  

## üìä Project Overview  
MarineData is a project dedicated to exploring marine biodiversity through the lens of the **National Geographic 2025 award-winning photographs** [https://www.nationalgeographic.com.es/fotografia/asombrosas-imagenes-ganadoras-underwater-photographer-of-the-year-2025_24326]. 
Using data analytics techniques, the project analyzes marine-related datasets to uncover simple yet meaningful insights into species distribution and environmental patterns.  

The goal is to combine **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with **interactive visualizations**, making the results accessible not only to scientists but also to a general audience interested in marine life and conservation.

## üìÅ Data Source  
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the **Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) API**, which provides open-access data on marine species observations worldwide.

Main tools and libraries include:  
- **Python**: Data extraction, cleaning, and EDA  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` ‚Üí data manipulation and processing  
  - `requests` ‚Üí API calls  
  - `re` ‚Üí data cleaning with regular expressions  
  - `geopy` ‚Üí geocoding and spatial analysis  
- **Tableau**: Creation of interactive dashboards and storytelling with data  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Documentation of analysis process  

Repository structure:  
- `extraccion_datos_final.ipynb` ‚Üí data extraction and preprocessing  
- `eda_final.ipynb` ‚Üí exploratory data analysis  
- `file` folder ‚Üí raw and cleaned datasets + `paletacolors.png` & `seal_boton.png` ‚Üí custom design elements for visualizations
- `marinedata_presentation.twbx` ‚Üí Tableau interactive visualizations [https://public.tableau.com/views/marinedata/FunFacts-dash?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link]

## üîç Key Findings  
Although the analysis focused on an introductory level, several patterns emerged:  
- **Seasonal variations**: Some species appear more frequently in certain times of the year.  
- **Geographical patterns**: Observations cluster around specific marine regions.  
- **Basic correlations**: Simple relationships were identified between species presence and environmental variables.  

These findings highlight how open marine data can be used to tell stories about biodiversity, even for audiences without a scientific background.
